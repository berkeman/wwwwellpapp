	<h2>Searching</h2>
	<p>
		The home page displays the latest posts added to wellpapp.
		On the left you have a search field where you can type in a
		search expression. Tags are separated by space, and can be
		prefixed with - to exclude, ! to require fully set tags,
		and ~ to require weakly set tags.
	</p>
	<p>
		Under this field there is a list of the most common tags in
		the search result you're viewing (excluding the tags you
		searched for). You can click on of them to see posts with
		that tag instead, or on + or - after them to include or
		exclude them from your current search.
	</p>
	<p>
		You also get links under each tag in your current search to
		modify how it is used (move your mouse over the tag to see
		them). They mean the same thing as in a search expression
		except that + means normal inclusion (no prefix in
		expression) and X removes the tag from your search.
	</p>
	<p>
		I you have a browser with modern javascript support you get
		completion in text fields (like the search box). This
		happens for any word you type with at least two characters.
		It pops up suggestions under the text field, you can use
		the mouse or arrow keys + enter to select one. In most
		browsers you can also press tab to get the common prefix of
		all suggestions (which is the whole thing if there is only
		a single suggestion).
	</p>
	<p>
		The suggestion mechanism tries to be clever, and will not
		suggest aliases unless nothing else matches, and will
		suggest approximate matches if nothing matches exactly.
	</p>
	<h2>Tagging</h2>
	<p>
		There are two ways to tag. The first is to go to an image
		and tag just that image. This works in all browsers. If you
		try to use a tag that doesn't exist you get to choose a
		type for it and create it.
	</p>
	<h3>Tagmode</h3>
	<p>
		The second (and much more convenient) way is to use the tag
		mode. This can be used on any search result (or search
		result-like page), but only if your browser has modern
		javascript support.
	</p>
	<p>
		First click Tagmode to enable it. You get the tagmode
		interface at the top of the page. Clicking a thumbnail
		toggles selecting that image, and you have buttons to
		select all, none, or the inverse of what you have selected
		now. Select the images you wish to tag.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you can add or remove tags to/from these images. Say
		you want them to have the tag foo, and the tag bar weakly,
		but not the tag baz. You would enter "foo ~bar -baz" and
		press enter (or click apply). If any of these tags don't
		exist, you will be presented with an opportunity to create
		them. Choose a type and click create, or click cancel to
		return the tag to your text field (maybe you misspelled
		it). It isn't possible to use the rest of tagmode while
		creating tags.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also click on one of the tags on the left to enter
		them in the field. Hovering over one of the images shows
		what tags it currently has.
	</p>
