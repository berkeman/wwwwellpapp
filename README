Web interface for wellpapp.

Supports basic operations, including tagging selections of images, and can
browse the filesystem so you don't have to make your images findable by a
search before you can tag them. You do have to import them though.

Quick start (with an Apache-like webserver):

Set AllowOverride All on the directory where you placed wwwwellpapp.
Optionally configure mod_python if you don't like CGIs.
Copy (or symlink) dbclient.py from wellpapp-pyclient into cgi/.
Create a .wellpapprc in the cgi directory with at least the following:

thumb_sizes=200 # you can use something else, but it might look bad
webbase=/path/ # where your server exposes wwwwellpapp root
server, port, image_base, thumb_base as in your normal rc.

If you want to browse the filesystem, also set browsebase to the directory
you want to browse under. Assuming webbase=/foo/ and browsebase=/test/ you
would go to /foo/browse/bar/ to view files in /test/bar/.

If you worry about efficiency, you can replace the RewriteRule for image.py
in .htaccess with something like this in your apache config:

RewriteRule ^/image/(\d+)/([0-9a-f])([0-9a-f]{2})([0-9a-f]{29})$ /thumb_base/$1/$2/$3/$2$3$4 [T=image/jpeg,L]
RewriteRule ^/image/([0-9a-f])([0-9a-f]{2})([0-9a-f]{29})\.([a-z]{3,4})$ /image_base/$1/$2/$1$2$3 [T=image/$4,L]

(RewriteRule doesn't work completely in .htaccess, so you have to put it in
the main configuration.)
