Web interface for wellpapp.

Supports basic operations, including tagging selections of images, and can
browse the filesystem so you don't have to make your images findable by a
search before you can tag them. You do have to import them though.

Requirements:
Python (3.6+)
Wellpapp (server + python library)
bottle.py (tested with 0.12.23)
mako (tested with 1.1.3)

Quick start:

Create a .wellpapprc in wwwwellpapp directory with at least the following:

thumb_sizes=200 # you can use something else, but it might look bad
webbase=/
fallback_width=800 # image width if js is unavailable
fallback_height=600 # image height if js is unavailable
server, port, image_base, thumb_base as in your normal rc.

If you want to browse the filesystem, also set browsebase to the directory
you want to browse under. Assuming browsebase=/test/ you would go to
/browse/bar/ to view files in /test/bar/.

If you worry about efficiency, you'll want to run under some WSGI container.
If you don't, you can just run it as "./main.py listen_ip listen_port".
